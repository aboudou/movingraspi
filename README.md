Differences between MovingRaspi and MovingRaspiPlus
---------------------------------------------------
* “MovingRaspi” is the “educational” version of the project. I will not evolve (except fixes for new versions of XCode / iOS), and is here to illustrate above steps.
* “MovingRaspiPlus” is the alive version of MovingRaspi. It will evolve through time, to test new concepts. Changes from MovingRaspi are :
	* Possibility to control MovingRaspi with iPhone accelerometer
	* Use of L293D motor driver instead of “manual” H-Bridge.
    * Support for [PiCheckVoltage](https://github.com/aboudou/picheckvoltage)
