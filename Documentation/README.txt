MovingRaspi is a work in progress and will greatly evolve as the project goes on.



MovingRaspi
===========

MovingRaspi is a project about motorizing a Raspberry Pi and controlling it with an iPhone.

Requirements
------------

* First of all : a Raspberry Pi.
* Some items described [here](https://goddess-gate.com/dc2/index.php/post/506).
* For server part :
	* Python (with Debian / Raspbian : packages “python” and “python-dev”).
	* SMBus library . On Raspbian, install package “python-smbus”.
	* Twisted library. On Raspbian, install package “python-twisted”.
	* Adafruit MCP230xx library (See below).
	* Adafruit I2C library (See below).
* For iPhone part :
	* An iPhone (or iPad, or iPod Touch)
	* XCode 4.5.2

To help you with the assembly, you may refer to the following files :

* You may need to download and install [Raspberry Part](https://github.com/adafruit/Fritzing-Library/blob/master/AdaFruit.fzbz) for Fritzing
* MovingRaspi concept.fzz : the concept assembly mockup (fire LED instead of transistors to illustrate MCP23008 use) to open with Fritzing
  ([http://fritzing.org/](http://fritzing.org/))
* MovingRaspi.fzz (EBC transistor) : the main assembly mockup (with EBC transistors) to open with Fritzing
  ([http://fritzing.org/](http://fritzing.org/))
* MovingRaspi.fzz (ECB transistor) : the main assembly mockup (with ECB transistors) to open with Fritzing
  ([http://fritzing.org/](http://fritzing.org/))
* Power.fzz : the example assembly for common power supply mockup to open with Fritzing
  ([http://fritzing.org/](http://fritzing.org/))


Installing Adafruit libraries
-----------------------------

Go into “Server” folder, then execute the following commands (you may need to install “curl” before) :
`curl -O https://raw.github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Raspberry-Pi-Python-Code/master/Adafruit_I2C/Adafruit_I2C.py`
`curl -O https://raw.github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Raspberry-Pi-Python-Code/master/Adafruit_MCP230xx/Adafruit_MCP230xx.py`

Depending on the date you got Adafruit\_MCP230xx.py, you may have a version which works with MCP23017 chip, but not with MCP23008 chip.

* If you have downloaded the file starting December 28, 2012, it will be OK.i
* If you have downloaded the file before December 27, 2012, you'll have to download it again.
* If you have downloaded the file on December 27, 2012, check at the beginning of the file for the following lines of code :

```
MCP23008_GPIOA  = 0x09
MCP23008_GPPUA  = 0x06
MCP23008_OLATA  = 0x0A
```

If they are present, you have the correct version of the file. If not, you have to download it again.

How to use MovingRaspi (server)
-------------------------------

You'll first have to build the assembly, and plug it to the Raspberry Pi. For now, check “Documentation/MovingRaspi concept.fzz” for a test assembly working with the current code (“Documentation/MovingRaspi.fzz” should be OK, but I can't guarantee it as I didn't yet received all parts for the assembly).

Then update “config.py” file to fit your needs.

When you're done, just launch MovingRaspi with `./Server/movingraspi.sh start` as
  root user. When you want / need to stop it, just execute `./Server/movingraspi.sh  stop` as root user.


How to use MovingRaspiRemote (iPhone)
-------------------------------------

Just open XCode project then build and install MovingRaspiRemote on your iDevice. If ypu don't have an Apple iOS Developper account, you may use MovingRaspiRemote within iOS Simulator.

When application is started, enter hostname (or IP adress) of your Raspberry Pi, and the server port (default value is 8000, unless changed into “config.py” file). Then tap "Connect" button.

When connected to the server, you may tap on direction buttons to control motors (on final assembly) or LEDs (on test assembly).
